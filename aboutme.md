Among the many current methodological innovations in the social sciences is the increasing use of **person-oriented methods**.
These methods have many advantages: They…
... help increasing the credibility of research findings, 
… reveal cases in which the most frequently used variable-oriented methods lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations,
… are inextricably entwined with machine learning and artificial intelligence applications that already shape how many researchers and organizations make decisions and sense of data,
… are needed and well-suited to examine cutting-edge research questions such as those related to personalized diagnostics, personalized intervention, or the heterogeneity revolution, among many others.

Although these advantages have been known for many decades, **person-oriented** methods have yet to find their way into the mainstream Social Science method toolbox.
This conference aims to initiate an interdisciplinary dialogue about advantages and bring communities with expertise on person-oriented methods, variable-oriented methods, heterogeneity, and personalized applications together (e.g., personalized learning, personalized medicine etc.)


We kindly ask for your participation in and your submissions to the first conference of the Society of Person-Orientated Research. The first conference is entitled **_"discussion on the validity of person- and variable-oriented methods"_** and will take place **online**.
